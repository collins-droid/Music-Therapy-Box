## Complete Post-Prediction Flow

After the system predicts stress level, here's the detailed process:

### Step-by-Step Process:

```
1. STRESS PREDICTION
   ‚Üì
2. MAP TO MUSIC CATEGORY
   ‚Üì
3. SELECT SONG
   ‚Üì
4. UPDATE LCD DISPLAY
   ‚Üì
5. START MUSIC PLAYBACK
   ‚Üì
6. MONITOR PLAYBACK LOOP
   ‚Üì
7. RE-EVALUATION (if needed)
   ‚Üì
8. CONTINUE OR STOP
```

### Detailed Code Flow:

**1. Prediction Made:**
```python
prediction = self.stress_predictor.predict(features)  # Returns "stress" or "no_stress"
confidence = self.stress_predictor.get_confidence()   # Returns 0.0 to 1.0
```

**2. Map to Music Category:**
```python
music_category = self._map_prediction_to_music(prediction)
# "stress" ‚Üí "stress" ‚Üí music/stress_relief/
# "no_stress" ‚Üí "no_stress" ‚Üí music/calming/
```

**3. Select Random Song:**
```python
song_path = self.music_player.select_song(music_category)
# Randomly picks a file from the appropriate folder
```

**4. Update LCD Display:**
```python
self._update_display_for_prediction(prediction, confidence)
# Shows: "Stress detected (0.85)\nPlaying calming music"
# OR: "Relaxed state (0.92)\nPlaying gentle music"
```

**5. Start Music Playback:**
```python
self.music_player.play(song_path)
# Begins playing the selected song
```

**6. Playback Monitoring Loop:**
```python
while self.music_player.is_playing() and self.session_active:
    # Monitor for STOP button presses
    # Schedule re-evaluation 60 seconds before song ends
    # Handle user interactions
```

**7. Re-evaluation (Smart Feature):**
- **Triggers**: 60 seconds before current song ends
- **Process**: Collects 10-second sensor sample
- **Action**: Makes new prediction and updates display
- **Purpose**: Ensures music matches current stress level

**8. Session Continuation:**
- **If STOP pressed**: Session ends
- **If song ends**: Collects new 60-second window ‚Üí New prediction ‚Üí New song
- **If re-evaluation**: Updates display with new status

### Key Features:

1. **Adaptive Music Selection**: Music changes based on real-time stress detection
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: System keeps checking stress levels
3. **Smart Re-evaluation**: Updates prediction before song ends
4. **User Control**: STOP button always available

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 15 features (7 HR + 8 EDA)
- **Training Data**: 1000 synthetic samples
- **Accuracy**: Binary stress/no-stress classification
- **Model File**: `model/random_forest/stress_random_forest.pkl`

### How Random Forest Works

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions. Here's how it works in our stress detection system:

**1. Multiple Decision Trees**
- Creates 200 individual decision trees (n_estimators=200)
- Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data
- Each tree uses a random subset of features for each split

**2. Training Process**
- Each tree learns different patterns in the HR and EDA data
- Trees vote on the final prediction (stress vs no_stress)
- Majority vote determines the final classification

**3. Feature Importance**
- Random Forest calculates which features are most important
- HR features (mean, std, range) and EDA features (mean, slope) typically rank highest
- Helps understand what physiological signals indicate stress

**4. Confidence Scoring**
- Provides probability scores for each prediction
- Higher confidence indicates more certain classification
- Used to determine music selection reliability

**5. Advantages for Stress Detection**
- Handles noise well (important for sensor data)
- Reduces overfitting through ensemble averaging
- Provides interpretable feature importance
- Works well with small datasets (1000 samples)

**6. Binary Classification**
- Output: 0 (no_stress) or 1 (stress)
- Threshold-based decision making
- Maps directly to music categories

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect Arduino and Pi components
2. **Music Files**: Add music files to `music/stress_relief/` and `music/calming/`
3. **Dependencies**: Install required Python packages
4. **Run**: `python main.py`
5. **Use**: Press START button to begin therapy session

The system creates a **continuous feedback loop** where the music adapts to your changing stress levels in real-time.
